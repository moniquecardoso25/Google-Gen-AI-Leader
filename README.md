# Google-Gen-AI-Leader 

Notes from the reference FreeCodeCamp in the link [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30diF8dKpAY)

AI -> Machine performs like human behavior
ML -> Machine get better at a task with no explicit programming
DL -> Machine has an artificial neural network to solve complex problem inspired by human brain
Gen AI -> Subset of AI, it generates out content like image, video, text and audio


## Difference between AI vs Generative AI

### AI
- Perform tasks requiring human intelligence that include: problem solving, understanding natural language, decision-making and recognizing speech annd images
- The goal is to analyze, interpret, and respond humam actions
- AI can be applicated in diverse areas like: natural language processing, expert systems, speech recognition, robotics
- It is used in a lot of industries for tasks like:
  - B2C -> Chatbots for customer service
  - Ecommerce -> Recommendation systems
  - Auto: Autonomous vehicles
  - Medical: Medical diagnosis

## Gen AI

Subset of AI focused on creating new content or data. It can interpret and analyze data but generates new datta itself.
- It generates text, images, music, speech and others.

Machine learning techniques:
- Transform models like GPT
- Generating Adversatial Networks (GANs)
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

  Modalities
  - Text -> human-like text
  - Molecular -> Drug discovery through genomic data
  - Audio -> music
  - Vision -> realistic images and videos
 
LLMs generates human-like text that is a subset of GenAI and often conflating with being AI

AI x Generative AI
Understand and decision-making x Creates new, original outputs (Functionality)
Analyzes and make decisiong through existing data x Uses existing data in order to generate new unseen content (Data Handling)
Spans across diverse sectors, data analysis, NLP, automation and healthcare x Content creation, deepfakes, design, synthetic data generation (Applications)
