# Google-Gen-AI-Leader 

Notes from the reference FreeCodeCamp in the link [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30diF8dKpAY).

AI -> Machine performs like human behavior.
ML -> Machine get better at a task with no explicit programming..
DL -> Machine has an artificial neural network to solve complex problem inspired by human brain.
Gen AI -> Subset of AI, it generates out content like image, video, text and audio.


## Difference between AI vs Generative AI

### AI
- Perform tasks requiring human intelligence that include: problem solving, understanding natural language, decision-making and recognizing speech annd images.
- The goal is to analyze, interpret, and respond humam actions.
- AI can be applicated in diverse areas like: natural language processing, expert systems, speech recognition, robotics.
- It is used in a lot of industries for tasks like:
  - B2C -> Chatbots for customer service.
  - Ecommerce -> Recommendation systems.
  - Auto: Autonomous vehicles.
  - Medical: Medical diagnosis.

## Gen AI

Subset of AI focused on creating new content or data. It can interpret and analyze data but generates new datta itself.
- It generates text, images, music, speech and others.

Machine learning techniques:
- Transform models like GPT.
- Generating Adversatial Networks (GANs).
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).

  Modalities
  - Text -> human-like text.
  - Molecular -> Drug discovery through genomic data.
  - Audio -> music.
  - Vision -> realistic images and videos.
 
LLMs generates human-like text that is a subset of GenAI and often conflating with being AI

AI x Generative AI
Understand and decision-making x Creates new, original outputs (Functionality).
Analyzes and make decisiong through existing data x Uses existing data in order to generate new unseen content (Data Handling).
Spans across diverse sectors, data analysis, NLP, automation and healthcare x Content creation, deepfakes, design, synthetic data generation (Applications).


## NLP 

Natural Language Processing -> Machine learning technique

It understands the context of a body related text

It:
- Interprets and analyzes text inside email messages and documents.
- Contextualises and interprets spoken sentiment analysis.
- Sythesizes speech like voice assistance that talk with a person.
- Translates spoken or writtenn phrases and sentences between laguages.
- Interpret spoken and writtend commands, determines apropriate actions.

Text wrangling and Pre-Processing -> Conversion, sanitiation, tokenization, streamming, lemmatization
Language Understanding (structure/syntax) -> Parts of speech (POS) tagging, chunking, dependencyy parsing, constituency parsing
Processing annd Functionality -> Named entity recognition (NER), n-gram identification, sentiment analysis, information exttraction, information retrieval, question and answering, topic modeling.
